# win7-transformation-pack
A Windows 7 transformation pack for Windows 10 LTSC 2021 IoT and 22H2.
This transformation pack converts Windows 10 21 and 22 H2 (which includes LTSC 2021 editions too). The transformation pack is made by ImSwordQueen. I have modified it by removing unnessacary stuff and uploaded it here. Orignal transformation pack is in deviantart.

To get an accurate Windows 7 look, you will have to go along as usual with the pack, select the branding as Windows 7 Ultimate, check every checkbox in the last menu except the legacy UAC one. This 
is because it breaks the User account control prompt and makes it unuseable.

Windows NT Modding Utility
I have decided to use this since it will allow us to apply a working classic UAC, help and support center, and games explorer which the transformation pack won't install.

WARNING! 
DO NOT use it on any other version of Windows, not even an older build of Windows 10. This is made for 21H2 (including LTSC 2021) and 22H2. Doing so will brick your system, since it completly updates your system.

Also remember to install Firefox 115 ESR with Beautyfox or IE 12, to get a working Interent Explorer.
